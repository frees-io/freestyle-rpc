# Mu-Scala

[Mu] is a suite of libraries and tools that help you build and maintain
microservices in a functional style.

While you focus on implementing the business logic for your service, let Mu take
care of the boilerplate, including:

* generation of model classes, service interfaces and clients from [Avro],
  [Protobuf] or [OpenAPI] <abbr title="Interface definition language">IDL</abbr>
  files
* serialization of requests and responses into Avro/Protobuf/JSON
* building high-performance [gRPC] servers and clients
* building HTTP REST servers and clients using [http4s]
* handling of streaming requests and responses using either [FS2] Stream or
  [Monix] Observable
* schema management and schema evolution
* metrics reporting
* ... and plenty more features on the way!

Specifically, Mu helps you to build:

* [gRPC] servers and clients based on either [Avro] or [Protobuf] protocol
  definitions
* REST servers and clients based on [OpenAPI] definitions
