# Tutorial: gRPC with Avro

[gRPC] supports [Protobuf] by default for serialization of requests and
responses, but it also allows you to use other serialization mechanisms,
including [Avro].

This tutorial will show you how to generate a Mu RPC service definition from an
[Avro] IDL file.

Then a [follow-up tutorial](grpc-server-client) will guide you through using
this service definition to create a fully working gRPC server or client.

This tutorial is aimed at developers who:

* are new to Mu-Scala
* have some understanding of Avro and `.avdl` file syntax
* have read the [Getting Started guide](../getting-started)

This document will focus on Avro. If you would like to use gRPC with Protobuf,
see the [gRPC with Protobuf tutorial](grpc-with-protobuf).

## Create a new Mu project

As described in the [Getting Started guide](../getting-started), we recommend
you use the Mu-Scala giter8 template to create a new skeleton project. This will
install and configure the `mu-srcgen` sbt plugin, which we will need to generate
Scala code from an Avro `.avdl` file.

When you create the project using `sbt new`, make sure to set
`create_sample_code` to `no`. That way you can start with an empty project, and
gradually fill in the implementation as you follow the tutorial.

You should also set `use_proto` to `no`, and `use_avro` to `yes`. This will
ensure the sbt project is correctly configured to generate code from Avro IDL
files.

## Write the IDL file

We're going to start by writing a `.avdl` file containing a couple of messages.
These messages will be used as the request and response types for a gRPC
endpoint later.

Copy the following Avro IDL and save it as
`protocol/src/main/resources/avro/hello.avdl`:

```plaintext
@namespace("com.example")
protocol Greeter {

  record HelloRequest {
    string name;
  }

  record HelloResponse {
    string greeting;
    boolean happy;
  }

}
```

## Generate Scala code

Now we have a `.avdl` file, we can generate Scala code from it.

Start sbt and run the `muSrcGen` task. This will discover the `.avdl` file,
parse it and generate corresponding Scala code.

Let's have a look at the code that Mu-Scala has generated. Open the file
`protocol/target/scala-2.12/src_managed/main/com/example/Greeter.scala` in your
editor of choice.

It should look something like this:

```scala
package com.example

import higherkindness.mu.rpc.internal.encoders.avro.bigDecimalTagged._
import higherkindness.mu.rpc.internal.encoders.avro.javatime._
import higherkindness.mu.rpc.protocol._

final case class HelloRequest(name: String)

final case class HelloResponse(greeting: String, happy: Boolean)
```

A few things to note:

* Mu-Scala has generated one case class for each Avro record
* The package name matches the namespace specified in the `.avdl` file

## Add an RPC service

We now have some model classes to represent our RPC request and response, but we
don't have any RPC endpoints. Let's fix that by adding a method to the Avro
protocol.

Add the following line to `hello.avro` to define an RPC endpoint:

```plaintext
HelloResponse SayHello(HelloRequest request);
```

Make sure that you add the line inside the `protocol` block, before the closing
curly brace.

## Regenerate the code

If you run the `muSrcGen` sbt task again, and inspect the
`protocol/target/scala-2.12/src_managed/main/com/example/Greeter.scala` file
again, it should look something like this:

```scala
package com.example

import higherkindness.mu.rpc.internal.encoders.avro.bigDecimalTagged._
import higherkindness.mu.rpc.internal.encoders.avro.javatime._
import higherkindness.mu.rpc.protocol._

final case class HelloRequest(name: String)

final case class HelloResponse(greeting: String, happy: Boolean)

@service(Avro,compressionType = Identity,namespace = Some("com.example"),methodNameStyle = Capitalize)
trait Greeter[F[_]] {

  def SayHello(request: com.example.HelloRequest): F[com.example.HelloResponse]

}
```

Now that our `.avdl` file has at least one method, we have an RPC service
definition, so a corresponding trait has been added to the generated code.

There's quite a lot going on there, so let's unpack it a bit.

* The trait is called `Greeter`, which matches the protocol name in the `.avdl`
  file.
* The trait contains a method for each endpoint in the service.
* Mu-Scala uses "tagless final" encoding: the trait has a higher-kinded
  type parameter `F[_]` and all methods return their result wrapped in `F[...]`.
    * As we'll see in a later tutorial, `F[_]` becomes an IO monad such as
      [cats-effect] `IO` when we implement a gRPC server or client.
* The trait is annotated with `@service`. This is a macro annotation. When we
  compile the code, it will create a companion object for the trait containing a
  load of useful helper methods for creating servers and clients. We'll see how
  to make use of these helpers in the next tutorial.
* The annotation has 4 parameters:
    1. `Avro` describes how gRPC requests and responses are serialized
    2. `Identity` means GZip compression of requests and responses is disabled
    3. `"com.example"` is the namespace in which the RPC endpoint will be
       exposed
    4. `Capitalize` means the endpoint will be exposed as `SayHello`, not
       `sayHello`.

These parameters can be customised using sbt settings. Take a look at the
[source generation reference](../reference/source-generation) for more details.
