# Generate sources from IDL

While it is possible to use Mu by hand-writing your service definitions, message
classes and clients in Scala, we recommend you use `sbt-mu-srcgen` to generate
this code from Protobuf/Avro/OpenAPI IDL files.

IDL files are language-agnostic, more concise than Scala code, easily shared
with 3rd parties, and supported by a lot of existing tools.

Mu can generate code from a number of different IDL formats:

* message classes, gRPC server and client from Protobuf `.proto` files (see the
  [Protobuf section](generate-sources-from-proto) for detailed instructions)
* message classes, gRPC server and client from Avro `.avpr` or `.avdl` files (see the
  [Avro section](generate-sources-from-avro))
* message classes and REST client from OpenAPI `.yaml` files (see the
  [OpenAPI section](generate-sources-from-openapi))

## Plugin Installation

Add the following line to _project/plugins.sbt_:

[comment]: # (Start Replace)

```scala
addSbtPlugin("io.higherkindness" % "sbt-mu-srcgen" % "0.20.1")
```

[comment]: # (End Replace)

## How to use the plugin

The `muSrcGen` sbt task generates Scala source code from IDL files.

The plugin will automatically integrate the source generation into your compile
process, so the sources are generated before compilation when you run the
`compile` task.

You can also run the sbt task manually:

```sh
$ sbt muSrcGen
```

## Import

You will need to add this import at the top of your `build.sbt`:

```scala
import higherkindness.mu.rpc.srcgen.Model._
```

## Settings

### muSrcGenIdlType

The most important sbt setting is `muSrcGenIdlType`, which tells the plugin what kind of
IDL files (Avro/Protobuf/OpenAPI) to look for.

```scala
muSrcGenIdlType := IdlType.Proto // or IdlType.Avro or IdlType.OpenAPI
```

### muSrcGenSerializationType

Another important setting is `muSrcGenSerializationType`, which specifies how
messages should be encoded on the wire. This should match the format you chose
for the `muSrcGenIdlType` setting:

* For Protobuf, choose `SerializationType.Protobuf`
* For Avro, choose either `SerializationType.Avro` or `SerializationType.AvroWithSchema`.
    * If you choose `Avro`, it means your client and server must always use
      exactly the same version of the schema.
    * If you choose `AvroWithSchema`, the writer schema will be included in
      every message sent, which introduces a bandwidth overhead but allows
      schema evolution. In other words, the server and client can use different
      versions of a schema, as long as they are compatible with each other.  See
      the [schema evolution](schema-evolution/avro) section for more details on
      schema evolution.
* For OpenAPI, this setting is ignored, so you don't need to set it.

```scala
muSrcGenSerializationType := SerializationType.Protobuf // or SerializationType.Avro or SerializationType.AvroWithSchema
```

### Other basic settings

| Setting | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `muSrcGenSourceDirs` | The list of directories where your IDL files can be found.<br/><br/>Note: all the directories configured as sources will be distributed in the resulting jar artifact preserving the same folder structure as in the source. | `Compile / resourceDirectory`, typically `src/main/resources/` |
| `muSrcGenIdlTargetDir` | The directory where all discovered IDL files will be copied in preparation for Scala code generation. The plugin will automatically copy the following to the target directory:<br/> * All the IDL files and directories in the directory specified by `muSrcGenSourceDirs`<br/> * All the IDL files extracted from the JAR files or sbt modules specified by `muSrcGenJarNames` (see the "Advanced settings" section below) | `Compile / resourceManaged`, typically `target/scala-2.12/resource_managed/main` |
| `muSrcGenTargetDir` | The directory where the `muSrcGen` task will write the generated files. The files will be placed in subdirectories based on the namespaces declared in the IDL files. | `Compile / sourceManaged`, typically `target/scala-2.12/src_managed/main/` |

**Note**: The directories referenced in `muSrcGenSourceDirs` must exist. Target directories will be created upon generation.

### Advanced settings

| Setting | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `muSrcGenJarNames` | A list of JAR file or sbt module names where extra IDL files can be found. See the [srcGenJarNames section](#musrcgenjarnames) section below for more details. | `Nil` |
| `muSrcGenIdlExtension` | The extension of IDL files to extract from JAR files or sbt modules. | * `avdl` if `muSrcGenIdlType` is `avro`<br/> * `proto` if `muSrcGenIdlType` is `Proto` |
| `muSrcGenBigDecimal` | Specifies how Avro `decimal` types will be represented in the generated Scala. `ScalaBigDecimalGen` produces `scala.math.BigDecimal`. `ScalaBigDecimalTaggedGen` produces `scala.math.BigDecimal` tagged with the 'precision' and 'scale' using a Shapeless tag, e.g. `scala.math.BigDecimal @@ (Nat._8, Nat._2)`. | `ScalaBigDecimalTaggedGen`
| `muSrcGenCompressionType` | The compression type that will be used by generated RPC services. Set to `higherkindness.mu.rpc.srcgen.Model.GzipGen` for Gzip compression. | `higherkindness.mu.rpc.idlgen.Model.NoCompressionGen` |
| `muSrcGenIdiomaticEndpoints` | Flag indicating if idiomatic gRPC endpoints should be used. If `true`, the service operations will be prefixed by the namespace and the methods will be capitalized. | `false` |
| `muSrcGenStreamingImplementation` | Specifies whether generated Scala code will use FS2 `Stream[F, A]` or Monix `Observable[A]` as its streaming implementation. FS2 is the default. This setting is only relevant if you have any RPC endpoint definitions that involve streaming. | `higherkindness.mu.rpc.srcgen.Model.Fs2Stream` |
| `muSrcGenMarshallerImports` | see explanation below | see explanation below |

### muSrcGenMarshallerImports

This setting specifies additional imports to add on top to the generated service files. This property can be used for importing extra codecs for your services.

By default:
  * `List(BigDecimalAvroMarshallers, JavaTimeDateAvroMarshallers)` if `muSrcGenSerializationType` is `Avro` or `AvroWithSchema` and `muSrcGenBigDecimal` is `ScalaBigDecimalGen`
  * `List(BigDecimalTaggedAvroMarshallers, JavaTimeDateAvroMarshallers)` if `muSrcGenSerializationType` is `Avro` or `AvroWithSchema` and `muSrcGenBigDecimal` is `ScalaBigDecimalTaggedGen`
  * `List(BigDecimalProtobufMarshallers, JavaTimeDateProtobufMarshallers)` if `muSrcGenSerializationType` is `Protobuf`.

The `JodaDateTimeAvroMarshallers` and `JodaDateTimeProtobufMarshallers` are also available, but they need the dependency `mu-rpc-marshallers-jodatime`.

You can also specify custom imports with the following:

```scala
muSrcGenMarshallerImports := List(higherkindness.mu.rpc.idlgen.Model.CustomMarshallersImport("com.sample.marshallers._"))
```

See the [Custom codecs section in core concepts](core-concepts#custom-codecs) for more information.

### muSrcGenJarNames

You can use IDL files packaged into artifacts within your classpath, e.g. JAR
files added to the classpath via `libraryDependencies`, or other sbt modules.

`muSrcGenJarNames` can be very useful when you want to distribute your `IDL` files
without binary code (to prevent binary conflicts in clients).

The following example shows how to set up a dependency with another artifact or
sbt module containing the IDL definitions (`foo-domain`):

```scala
//...
.settings(
  Seq(
      muSrcGenIdlType := IdlType.Avro,
      muSrcGenSerializationType := SerializationType.AvroWithSchema,
      muSrcGenJarNames := Seq("foo-domain"),
      muSrcGenTargetDir := (Compile / sourceManaged).value / "compiled_avro",
      libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
        "io.higherkindness" %% "mu-rpc-channel" % V.muRPC
      )
  )
)
//...
```

## Implementation note: two-stage code generation

For gRPC services generated from an Avro or Protobuf definition, there are
actually two stages of code generation at work.

1. The `sbt-mu-srcgen` plugin will parse your IDL files and transform them into
   Scala code. It writes this code to `.scala` files under
   `target/scala-2.12/src_managed`.

2. The generated Scala code contains `@service` macro annotations. When these
   files are compiled, the compiler will expand these annotations by executing a
   macro, which generates a load of boilerplate code to help with building a
   gRPC server or client.

For example, the following `.proto` file:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package foo.bar;

message MyRequest {
  string a = 1;
}

message MyResponse {
  string a= 1;
}

service MyService {
  rpc MyEndpoint (MyRequest) returns (MyResponse);
}
```

would result in a `.scala` file that looks like (slightly simplified):

```scala
package foo.bar

object myproto {
  final case class MyRequest(a: String)
  final case class MyResponse(a: String)

  @service(Protobuf) trait MyService[F[_]] {
    def MyEndpoint(req: MyReqeust): F[MyResponse]
  }
}
```

After the `@service` annotation is expanded at compile time, the entire
generated code would look something like:

```scala
package foo.bar

object myproto {
  final case class MyRequest(a: String)
  final case class MyResponse(a: String)

  @service(Protobuf) trait MyService[F[_]] {
    def MyEndpoint(req: MyReqeust): F[MyResponse]
  }

  object MyService {

    def bindService[F[_]: ConcurrentEffect](
      implicit algebra: MyService[F]
    ): F[io.grpc.ServerServiceDefinition] = ...

    def client[F[_]: ConcurrentEffect: ContextShift](
      channelFor: higherkindness.mu.rpc.ChannelFor,
      channelConfigList: List[higherkindness.mu.rpc.channel.ManagedChannelConfig] = List(UsePlaintext),
      options: io.grpc.CallOptions = io.grpc.CallOptions.DEFAULT
    ): Resource[F, MyService[F]] = ...

    def clientFromChannel[F[_]: ConcurrentEffect: ContextShift](
      channel: F[io.grpc.ManagedChannel],
      options: io.grpc.CallOptions = io.grpc.CallOptions.DEFAULT
    ): Resource[F, MyService[F]]

    def unsafeClient[F[_]: ConcurrentEffect: ContextShift](
      channelFor: higherkindness.mu.rpc.ChannelFor,
      channelConfigList: List[higherkindness.mu.rpc.channel.ManagedChannelConfig] = List(UsePlaintext),
      options: io.grpc.CallOptions = io.grpc.CallOptions.DEFAULT
    ): MyService[F] = ...

    def unsafeClientFromChannel[F[_]: ConcurrentEffect: ContextShift](
      channel: io.grpc.ManagedChannel,
      options: io.grpc.CallOptions = io.grpc.CallOptions.DEFAULT
    ): MyService[F]

  }

}
```

You can see that the macro has generated a `MyService` companion object
containing a number of helper methods for building gRPC servers and clients.

We will make use of these helper methods when we wire everything together to
build a working server and client in the [patterns](patterns) section.
