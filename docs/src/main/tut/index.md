# Quickstart

## What’s frees-rpc

[frees-rpc] provides the ability to combine [RPC] protocols, services, and clients in your `Freestyle` program, thanks to [gRPC]. Although it's fully integrated with [gRPC], there are some important differences when defining the protocols, as we’ll see later on, since [frees-rpc] follows the same philosophy as `Freestyle` core, being macro-powered.
