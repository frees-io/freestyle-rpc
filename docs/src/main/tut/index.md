# Quickstart

## What is mu-rpc?

[mu] provides the ability to combine [RPC] protocols, services, and clients in your `Freestyle` program, thanks to [gRPC]. Although it's fully integrated with [gRPC], there are some important differences when defining the protocols, as weâ€™ll see later on, since [mu] follows the same philosophy as `Freestyle` core, being macro-powered.

## Installation

[comment]: # (Start Replace)

The current version for [mu] is `0.16.0` using the following common libraries and versions. 

[comment]: # (End Replace)

 * [cats-effect] 0.10.1
 * [Monix] 3.0.0-RC1
 * [fs2] 0.10.6

`mu-rpc` is cross-built for Scala `2.11.x` and `2.12.x`.

To use the project, add the following to your build.sbt:

```addCompilerPlugin("org.scalamacros" % "paradise" % "2.1.1" cross CrossVersion.patch)```

We've found that the compiler plugin needs to be added to your build.sbt file *after* your library dependencies due to the manner in which SBT evaluates the build file. 

[mu] is divided into multiple artifacts, grouped by scope:

* `Server`: specifically for the RPC server.
* `Client`: focused on the RPC auto-derived clients by `mu-rpc`.
* `Server/Client`: used from other artifacts for both Server and Client.
* `Test`: useful to test `mu-rpc` applications.

*Artifact Name* | *Scope* | *Mandatory* | *Description*
--- | --- | --- | ---
`mu-rpc-server` | Server | Yes | Needed to attach RPC Services and spin-up an RPC Server.
`mu-rpc-client-core` | Client | Yes | Mandatory to define protocols and auto-derived clients.
`mu-rpc-client-netty` | Client | Yes* | Mandatory on the client side if we are using `Netty` on the server side.
`mu-rpc-client-okhttp` | Client | Yes* | Mandatory on the client side if we are using `OkHttp` on the server side.
`mu-config` | Server/Client | No | Provides configuration helpers using [mu-config] to load the application configuration values.
`mu-rpc-marshallers-jodatime` | Server/Client | No | Provides marshallers for serializing and deserializing the `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime` joda instances.
`mu-rpc-prometheus-server` | Server | No | Scala interceptors which can be used to monitor gRPC services using Prometheus, on the _Server_ side.
`mu-rpc-prometheus-client` | Client | No | Scala interceptors which can be used to monitor gRPC services using Prometheus, on the _Client_ side.
`mu-rpc-prometheus-shared` | Server/Client | No | Common code for both the client and the server in the prometheus scope.
`mu-rpc-dropwizard-server` | Server | No | Scala interceptors which can be used to monitor gRPC services using Dropwizard metrics, on the _Server_ side.
`mu-rpc-dropwizard-client` | Client | No | Scala interceptors which can be used to monitor gRPC services using Dropwizard metrics, on the _Client_ side.
`mu-rpc-interceptors` | Server/Client | No | Commons related to gRPC interceptors.
`mu-rpc-testing` | Test | No | Utilities to test out `mu-rpc` applications. It provides the `grpc-testing` library as the transitive dependency.
`mu-common` | Server/Client | Provided* | Common things that are used throughout the project.
`mu-rpc-internal` | Server/Client | Provided* | Macros.
`mu-rpc-async` | Server/Client | Provided* | Async instances useful for interacting with the RPC services on both sides, server and the client.
`mu-rpc-netty-ssl` | Server/Client | No | Adds the `io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-static:jar` dependency, aligned with the Netty version (if that's the case) used in the `mu-rpc` build. See [this section](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/SECURITY.md#netty) for more information. By adding this you wouldn't need to figure the right version, `mu-rpc` gives you the right one.

* `Yes*`: on the client-side, you must choose either `Netty` or `OkHttp` as the transport layer.
* `Provided*`: you don't need to add it to your build, it'll be transitively provided when using other dependencies.

You can install any of these dependencies in your build as follows:

[comment]: # (Start Replace)

```scala
// required for the RPC server:
libraryDependencies += "io.higherkindness" %% "mu-rpc-server"            % "0.16.0"

// required for a protocol definition:
libraryDependencies += "io.higherkindness" %% "mu-rpc-client-core"       % "0.16.0"

// required for the use of the derived RPC client/s, using either Netty or OkHttp as transport layer:
libraryDependencies += "io.higherkindness" %% "mu-rpc-client-netty"      % "0.16.0"
// or:
libraryDependencies += "io.higherkindness" %% "mu-rpc-client-okhttp"     % "0.16.0"

// optional - for both server and client configuration.
libraryDependencies += "io.higherkindness" %% "mu-config"                % "0.16.0"

// optional - for both server and client metrics reporting, using Prometheus.
libraryDependencies += "io.higherkindness" %% "mu-rpc-prometheus-server" % "0.16.0"
libraryDependencies += "io.higherkindness" %% "mu-rpc-prometheus-client" % "0.16.0"

// optional - for both server and client metrics reporting, using Dropwizard.
libraryDependencies += "io.higherkindness" %% "mu-rpc-dropwizard-server" % "0.16.0"
libraryDependencies += "io.higherkindness" %% "mu-rpc-dropwizard-client" % "0.16.0"

// optional - for the communication between server and client by using SSL/TLS.
libraryDependencies += "io.higherkindness" %% "mu-rpc-netty-ssl" % "0.16.0"

// optional - for using the jodatime marshallers.
libraryDependencies += "io.higherkindness" %% "mu-rpc-marshallers-jodatime" % "0.16.0"
```
