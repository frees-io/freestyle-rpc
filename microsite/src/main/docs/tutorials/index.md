# Tutorials

These tutorials are aimed at beginners to Mu-Scala.

We recommend you read them in roughly the order they appear in the navigation
menu.

Before starting the tutorials, we recommend you read the [Getting Started
guide](getting-started).

If you are already familiar with Mu-Scala, you may want to read about how to use
its more advanced features in the [How-To Guides](guides).
