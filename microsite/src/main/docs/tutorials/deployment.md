# Tutorial: Deploying a Mu service

We don't have documentation for this yet, but you may find this article useful:
[Mu in the cloud](https://www.47deg.com/blog/mu-in-the-cloud-with-kubernetes/).
It goes into significant detail, explaining how to deploy an example Mu
application to Kubernetes in Google Cloud Platform.

All of the code for that article is also available [on
GitHub](https://github.com/47deg/mu-smart-home) for reference.
