  Four different terminals, run (in order of appearance):
    1.- sbt health-server/run
    2.- sbt "health-client/run 1 watch"
    3.- sbt "health-client/run 2 watch"
    4.- sbt "health-client/run 1"
  Expect:
    1.- it runs service
    2.- it watches "example1" service to update health status
    3.- it watches "example2" service to update health status
    4.- it updates health status for example 1
