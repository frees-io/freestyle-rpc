Mu RPC is a purely functional library for building [RPC] endpoint-based services with support for [RPC] and [HTTP/2].

Also known as [mu], it brings the ability to combine [RPC] protocols, services, and clients in your Scala program, thanks to [gRPC].

## Documentation

The full documentation is available at the [mu](https://higherkindness.github.io/mu) site.
